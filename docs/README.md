# preCICE #

preCICE stands for Precise Code Interaction Coupling Environment. Its main component is a library that can be used by simulation programs to be coupled together in a partitioned way, enabling multi-physics simulations, such as fluid-structure interaction.

It is being developed at the Technical University of Munich and at the University of Stuttgart.

The website of preCICE can be found at [www.precice.org](http://www.precice.org).
