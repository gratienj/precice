- Added API methods for entering gradient data in the solver interface. Methods available are for scalar gradient data, vector gradient data, block scalar gradient data and block vector gradient data
- Added tests for nearest-neighbor-gradient mapping using the API methods.
  - Added integration tests for parallel execution: to test read consistent mapping for scalar and vector data.
  - Added integration tests for serial execution: to test read and write consistent mapping for scalar and vector data and test the different block methods
- Changed the coupling scheme base class to additionally send gradient data 
- Changed the m2n communication to send gradient data
