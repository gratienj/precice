- Replaced all `<mapping:rbf... />` related tags. RBF mappings are now defined in terms of the applied solver (`<mapping:rbf-global-direct ...` or `<mapping:rbf-global-iterative`) and the applied basis function is a subtag of the solver. Users should use the additionally added auto selection of an appropriate solver as follows: `<mapping:rbf  ...> <basis-function:... /> </mapping:rbf>`. Example: `<mapping:compact-polynomial-c0 direction="read" from= ... support-radius="0.3" />` would become `<mapping:rbf  direction="read" from= ...> <basis-function:compact-polynomial-c0 support-radius="0.3" /> </mapping:rbf>`
- Renamed `<mapping:rbf... use-qr-decomposition="true" />` to `<mapping:rbf-global-direct ... > <basis-function:... /> </mapping:rbf-global-direct>`
