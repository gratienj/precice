- Added communication of substeps data for waveform coupling. A new attribute `substeps` in the `exchange` tag allows activating and deactivating this additional communication. `substeps` defaults to `false`, since not yet all acceleration schemes support this feature. This default may change once preCICE is fully ported to handling waveforms.  See https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/1825 for details.
