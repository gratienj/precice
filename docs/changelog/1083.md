- Simplified interface of `time::Waveform` by storing and updating number of past time windows inside waveform. A newly created waveform only has a single stored sample in `_storedTimeWindows`, which is initialized as zero. `Waveform::store()` is used to update stored data in the waveform. Calling `Waveform::moveToNextWindow()` creates a new sample, initializes it with an initial guess, stores it in the buffer `_storedTimeWindows` and discards old samples, if the buffer is full. The counter for stored samples is automatically increased.
