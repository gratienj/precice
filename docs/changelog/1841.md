- Removed `min-iteration-convergence-measure`, use the new `min-iterations` tag or `max-iterations` instead.
- Added support for implicit coupling schemes without convergence measures, which will always iterate `max-iterations` times per time window. Not defining convergence measures now requires `max-iterations` to be defined.
- Added tag `min-iterations` to coupling schemes, which allows defining a minimal amount of iterations before convergence measures are taken into account.
