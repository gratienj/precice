- Changed API function `Participant::getMaxTimeStepSize()` to return `dt = 0.0` if called after `final advance(dt)`
- Changed API function `Participant::readData(...)` to only accept `relativeReadTime = 0.0`, if called after final `advance(dt)` (i.e. not `isCouplingOngoing()`)
- Changed API function `Participant::readData(...)` such that it may only be called after `initialize()`
- Changed API function `Participant::writeData(...)` such that it may only be called before the final `advance(dt)` (i.e. not isCouplingOngoing())
