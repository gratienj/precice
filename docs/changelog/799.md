* Sorted out and improved convergence measure logging:
  * Increased readability of relative convergence measure INFO logs.
  * Extended title headers of convergence and iteration files by measure abbreviation.
  * Allowed multiple convergence measures of same coupling data.
  * Suppressd convergence file logging for min-iterations convergence measure.
  * Removed logging of average convergence rates.
  * Extended iteration logging by total and dropped quasi-Newton columns.
