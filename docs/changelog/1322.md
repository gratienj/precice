- Removed edge IDs from the API: `setMeshEdge` now returns nothing, all `setMeshXWithEdges` variants were removed from the API, and `setMeshTriangle|Quad` now accepts vertex IDs instead of edge IDs.
- Added efficient bulk functions `setMeshEdges|Triangles|Quads|Tetrahedra` for setting connectivity based on an array of vertex IDs.
- Changed API to guarantee the creation of hierarchical connectivity. For example, `setMeshTriangle` now ensures necessary edges exist internally.
