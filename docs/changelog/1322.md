- Removed edge IDs from the API. `setMeshEdge` now returns nothing, `setMeshXWithEdges` were remove from the API, and `setMeshTriangle|Quad` accepts vertex IDs instead of edge IDs.
- Added efficient bulk functions `setMeshEdges|Triangles|Quads|Tetrahedra` for setting connectivity based on an array of vertex IDs.
- Changed API to guarantee the creation of hierarchical connectivity. As an example `setMeshTriangle` will create necessary edges.
