- Replaced `isActionRequired()` and `markActionFulfilled()` with explicit calls `requiresInitialData()`, `requiresReadingCheckpoint()`, and `requiresWritingCheckpoint()`. Invoking these functions is a promise to preCICE that the caller fulfills the requirement.
- Removed `precice::constants` from the C++ API and the C and Fortran bindings.
- Added `precicef_get_version_information_` to Fortran bindings.
- Renamed `isMeshConnectivityRequired()` to `requiresMeshConnectivityFor()`
- Renamed `isGradientDataRequired()` to `requiresGradientDataFor()`
