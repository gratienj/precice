 * @brief Stores data samples in time and allows to perform interpolation.
 *
 * The constructor Waveform(interpolationOrder) creates a Storage for the samples that are used to create the interpolant.
 * After creation of the waveform it must be initialized with Waveform::initialize(value) to finally reserve the storage. All newly added values must have the same dimension as the initially provided values.
 * The waveform is initialized with two data values at the beginning and at the end of the window as a constant function. Waveform::store(value) allows the user to provide new data to the Waveform. Interpolation is performed based on these values.
 * The available interpolation order depends on the number of stored samples and can reach the interpolationOrder defined during construction as a maximum. If more samples are available than the maximum order requires, a piecewise interpolation will be used (piecewise constant, piecewise linear and B-Spline interpolation).
 * Interpolation is only performed inside the current time window. If the waveform should be used for the next time window, Waveform::moveToNextWindow() allows the user to use the data at the end of the current window as an initial guess for the next window.
