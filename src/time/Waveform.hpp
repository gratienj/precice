 * @brief Allows to perform interpolation on samples in storage of given data.

 * The constructor Waveform(degree, data) creates a waveform. The samples of the data's storage are used to create the interpolant.
 * The waveform is initialized with two data values at the beginning and at the end of the window as a constant function. Waveform::store(value) allows the user to provide new data to the Waveform. Interpolation is performed based on these values.
 * The maximum allowed polynomial degree depends on the number of stored samples and can reach the interpolationDegree defined during construction as a maximum. If more samples are available than the maximum degree requires, a piecewise interpolation will be used (piecewise constant, piecewise linear and B-Spline interpolation).
 * Interpolation is only performed inside the current time window.
