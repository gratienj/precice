# preCICE Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. For future plans, see our [Roadmap](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Roadmap).

## develop

- drop official python2 support for python bindings ([remove tests](https://github.com/precice/systemtests/commit/dba924447996574967b2295cf652fb32bec58020)).
- Introduce preCICE-MATLAB bindings (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/494)

## 1.6.1

- Fixed a platform-dependent issue with boost.

## 1.6.0

- Added CMake target to uninstall the project.
- Added `INFO` log output of the connection build-up during the instantiation. This dramatically simplifies the identification of connection-related problems.
- Added `precice::getVersionInformation()` to the interface. This returns a semicolon separated list of information containing the version, configuration, compiler and flags used to compile the library.
- Added additional checks for wrong user input in SolverInterface.
- Added basic index validation of user input to the SolverInterface
- Added events for mapping internals such as the computation of the mapping and the index-generation.
- Added more "pythonic" python bindings `precice_future`. More: [here](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/379) and [here](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/458)
- Added overrides for dependencies, allowing users to force CMake to use a given version. [Read more](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Building:-Using-CMake#xsdk-compliance)
- Added support for the `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` environment variables. [Read more](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Building:-Using-CMake#xsdk-compliance)
- Added support for the xsdk default mode. [Read more](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Building:-Using-CMake#xsdk-compliance)
- Added the CMake variable `PRECICE_CTEST_MPI_FLAGS` which can be used to pass additional flags to `mpirun`. A common use-case is to enable oversubscribing on machines with only 2 cores by passing `--oversubscribe`.
- Added the possibility to pass a custom `MPI_Comm` to preCICE via a new SolverInterface constructor. The passed communicator is then used as the global internal communicator. The user has to ensure that the mpi implementations of preCICE and the caller code are consistent and compatible.
- Added the result of `git describe --tags --dirty` to the library, which is now displayed during the configuration of preCICE. This allows quickly check what commit you are actually using and whether there were local changes.
- Added tests for python bindings using a mocked preCICE C++ Interface. [Read more](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/420)
- Added validation of dependencies in the CMake script.
- Changed the connection publishing to a hash-based approach. This method is faster, more robust and NFS-friendly. The files are rooted in the folder `precice-run`, deleting this folder resolves most connection problems.
- Changed the errors in the configuration stage to throw `std::runtime_error`.
- Changed the id management from `std::set` to `boost::container::flat_set`. This reduces the peak memory consumption of meshes by about 9%.
- Changed the log output for filtered vertices. Log level `INFO` prints the total number of filtered vertices. The detailed information was moved to `DEBUG`.
- Changed the scope of the generated `version.[ch]pp` files to `precice/impl`. This prevents collisions with other random version headers.
- Changed and optimized the index generation for an individual speed up of 10-20x.
- Changed and optimized some complexity issues in the generation of communication maps for an individual speedup of around 1000x for bigger meshes.
- Changed and optimized some complexity issues in `NearestNeighbour::tagFirstRound` leading to an individual speedup of around 100x.
- Deprecated the python bindings `precice`, which will be removed in preCICE Version 2.0.0. If you still want to use them, please install `precice` and `precice_future`. Our recommendation, if you want to use the new bindings: Use `import precice_future as precice`.
- Fixed a bug in the python bindings which ignored the memory layout of numpy array. We now use `numpy.ascontiguousarray` to guarantee a C-compatible layout of data structures. [Read more](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/448)
- Fixed a major memory issue due to excessive logger instantiations. This reduced peak memory consumption and allocation count of meshes by 50%.
- Fixed compatibility with Eigen versions `>3.3.7`.
- Fixed macro namespace by using the `PRECICE_` prefix. This prevents collisions with foreign macros.
- Fixed the index-based version of the nearest projection mapping and reintegrated it.
- Fixed wrong user input in Triangle creation to trigger assertions instead of a comprehensive user error.
- Fixed a bug in MPI initialization when using PETRBF mappings.
- Fixed a warning message in `ReceivedPartition` displaying a wrong vertex count.

## 1.5.2

- Fixed faulty communication in `master:sockets` leading to crashes.

## 1.5.1

- Fixed the exposure of `boost::asio` implementation details leading to version incompatibilities
- Fixed the CMake linkage of Boost to become compatible with the generated CMake config of Boost 1.70.0

## 1.5.0

- Added CMake alias `precice::precice` which mimics the namespaced library name after calling `find_package(precice)`. This allows seamless use as a subproject.
- Added state-awareness to the SolverInterface to keep track of the Mesh states. This results more informative error messages for mesh related functions.
- Added faster `PetRadialBasisFctMapping` tagging using RTree queries.
- Added potentially missing signal `SIGXCPU`.
- Added sanitization of IDs to the SolverInterface and harden it against misconfiguration using a consistent mechanism to express requirements.
- Added support for using preCICE directly from the binary tree using `precice_DIR` in other projects.
- Added target `test_install`, which can be used to test the install. It configures builds and runs the cpp solverdummy using the installed preCICE library.
- Added the ability to send a mesh to multiple participants.
- Added the attribute `Participant` to the logger, which is now available in format and filter expressions.
- Added the automatic creation of target directories, when exporting meshes with `<export:vtk ...>`.
- Added the data name to the log output of convergence measures.
- Added the generation of a pkg-config file for preCICE, which is usable after installing.
- Added the generation of code coverage reports.
- Changed the tested build-system in CI from SCons to CMake.
- Fixed a **critical bug** in the nearest projection mapping rooting in the variant index tree. We decided to roll-back to the old implementation until there is a fix.
- Fixed PETSc complaining about unused arguments when running tests.
- Fixed `bindings/fortran` to use `precice::SolverInterface` instead of `precice::impl::SolverInterfaceImpl`
- Fixed a potential integer overflow when parsing huge numbers in the configuration code.
- Fixed a potential overflow in the computation of the side length of bounding boxes.
- Fixed bug in preconditioner when we have convergence in the first iteration.
- Fixed integration tests resetting the log-level by calling `configure`.
- Fixed missing includes for Eigen
- Fixed overuse of `std::endl` in code, file generation should be noticeably faster now.
- Fixed the `const`ness of passed pointer arguments as well as some member functions of the `SolverInterface`.
- Fixed the default safety factor for nearest projection mapping by increasing it from 0.1 to 0.5.
- Fixed Python bindings now offer all preCICE API functions (except `get_mesh_handle`)
- Fixed CMake now properly detects PETSc on systems with a directory-scoped MPI installation (`include/openmpi/mpi.h`) when the compiler was not set to the MPI compiler wrapper.
- Refactored `Mesh::computeState` into two logical units, improving the trace information.
- Refactored `computePartitions` using the stl.
- Refactored logger which dramatically reduces compile times.
- Refactored the M2N handling code, which improves the available trace information for issues related to the M2N initialization.
- Removed [`#395`](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/395) API functions `nameConfiguration(), dataDisplacements(), dataForces(), dataVelocities(), actionPlotOutput(), exportVTK(), exportAll()` from CPP API and all language bindings.
- Removed ancient `PRECIE_NO_SOCKETS` definition.
- Removed dead configuration code.
- Sending data between participants is now fully asynchronous. This is relevant in one-way coupling scenarios, where the sending participant doesn't need to wait for the receiving one.

## 1.4.1

- Bug in re-partitioning fixed, occured for OpenFOAM and empty ranks in parallel. 

## 1.4.0
- The python modules are now proper packages tracking dependencies etc.
- Fix CMake now importable from binary directory.
- The Python module for the preCICE bindings `PySolverInterface` is renamed to `precice`. This change does not break old code. Please refer to [`src/precice/bindings/python/README.md`](src/precice/bindings/python/README.md) for more information.
- Add a pkg-config for preCICE (`libprecice.pc`).
- Use the Boost stacktrace library for cross-platform stacktrace printing. **This requires Boost 1.65.1**.
- Added explicit linking to `libdl` for `boost::stacktrace`.
- Reimplemented the internals of the nearest-projection mapping to significantly reduce its initialization time.
- The EventTimings now do a time normalization among all ranks, i.e., the first event is considered to happen at t=0, all other events are adapted thereto.
- The old CSV format of the EventTimings log files, split among two files was replaced by a single file, in structured JSON format.
- Fixed memory leaks in the `xml::XMLAttributes` and `xml::Validator*`.
- Removed the `xml::Validator*` classes and replaced them in `xml::XMLAttribute` with a set of "options".
- Made `xml::XMLAttribute` and `xml::XMLTag` chainable.
- Added manpages for binprecice and testprecice.
- Fixed memory leaks in `mesh::Mesh`.
- Fixed mapping classes not flushing the underlying caches on `clear()`.
- Fixed format of version logging (first preCICE log message).
- Added tolerance of iterations in quasi-Newton tests.
- CMake overhaul:
  - Converted to target-based system: precice, testprecice, binprecice
  - New options:
    - `PRECICE_Packages` (default ON) to configure CPack,
    - `PRECICE_InstallTest` (default ON) to configure installation of tests.  
      This includes the binary `testprecice` and necessary files.
      Use `PREFIX/share/precice` as `PRECICE_ROOT`.
  - Moved CMake files from `tools/cmake-modules` to `cmake/` (general scripts) and `cmake/modules` (find modules).
  - Migrated from file-globing to explicit source/interface/test-file lists.  
    Use `tools/updateSourceFiles.py` from project-root to update all necessary files.
  - `install` target installs:
     - the library `PREFIX/lib`.
     - the binaries `PREFIX/bin` and their manfiles into `PREFIX/share/man/man1`.
     - the CMake configuration files into `PREFIX/lib/cmake/precice`.
     - the pkg-config configuration files into `PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig`
     - the necessary files to run testprecice into `PREFIX/share/precice`. Use this as `PRECICE_ROOT` on installed system.
  - CTest definition of tests run in isolated working directories:
    - `precice.Base` for the base test suite
    - `precice.MPI2` run on 2 MPI ranks
    - `precice.MPI4` run on 4 MPI ranks
  - CPack configuration of target `package` to generate binary debian, tar and zip packages.
  - Added `CMakeLists.txt` to `tools/solverdummy/cpp`. It is an example of how to link to preCICE with CMake.
  - Extended the displayed information when configuring.
- Extended `updateSourceFiles.py` to verify the sources using `git ls-files --full-name` if available.
- Fixed the `io::VTKXMLExporter` not to write VertexNormals.
- Improved the user-friendliness of the tests.
  - `make test` will run all tests.
  - `make test_base` only a unproblematic base-set.
  - A timeout will kill hanging tests.
  - All tests sets run in isolated working directories.
- Added an (experimental) Fortran 2003 solver dummy.

## 1.3.0
- Update of build procedure for python bindings (see [`precice/src/bindings/python/README.md`](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/src/precice/bindings/python/README.md) for instructions). Note: you do not have to add `PySolverInterface.so` to `PYTHONPATH` manually anymore, if you want to use it in your adapter. Python should be able to find it automatically.   
- Make naming of log files consistent, following the pattern `precice-SOLVERNAME-logtype.log`, example: `precice-FLUID-eventTimings.log`
- Enable boost.geometry based preallocation. Speeds up initialization of PetRBF based mapping.
- Actions can now specify a `MeshRequirement`, such as the `ScaleByAreaAction`.
- Many events have been reworked and are now uniformly named. 
- There is a `syncMode` for events (for detailed performance measurements), configurable and off by default. 

## 1.2.0
- Make `polynomial=separate` the default setting for PetRBF.
- Removed ExportVRML functionality
- Build system:
  - Make `python=off` default.
- Building with Conda:
  - The helper scripts are now placed in the directory `tools/conda_building`. All the terms refering to `Anaconda` have been changed to `Conda`.
- Sending data exchange is now fully asynchronous, so that the sending participant never waits for the receiving one.
- Rename `src/precice/adapters` to `src/precice/bindings`
- adding `libprefix` option in scons build process to allow for non-standard library paths

## 1.1.1
- Fix SConstruct symlink build target failing when using lowercase build (debug, release) names.

## 1.1.0
- Build system:
  - Remove the `staticlib` and `bin` from the default targets to reduce the building time and storage requirements.
  - Change build types to mixed case, i.e. ```Debug``` and ```Release```. Old versions are retained for backward compatibility.
  - Make `mpicxx` default setting for compiler.
  - Experiemental support for building with Conda, see `tools/anaconda_building`
  - Use NumPy to figure out Python include paths.
  - Search for PETSc in more paths
  - Add experimental CMake build control files.

- Add a job command file for the SuperMUC HPC system in `tools`.
- `compileAndTest.py` Change the `-b` option to `-t`, do not crash when ./tests do no exist, make `mpirun` command configurable
- Use `libxml2` for XML parsing, this makes `libxml2-dev` a dependency.
- Update EventTimings framework.
- Add python script to plot Events on a timeline.
- PETSc RBF mapping now supports conservative mapping with a separated polynomial
- Converted all tests to the new, boost test based, unit testing framework.
- Removed the `tarch` legacy library.
- Use `boost::signal2` for implement observer pattern for the Mesh class.
- Add contributer guidelines.
